# Sierra Softworks Blog
This is the code behind the official Sierra Softworks blog website.
It is built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and the
[TranquilPeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak)
theme (with some customizations and tweaks).

It is automatically built using [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) and
deployed as a [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sierrasoftworks/blog)
on top of [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io).
