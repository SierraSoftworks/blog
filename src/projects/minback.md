# Minback
Minback (short for Minio-backup) is a set of containerized backup tools designed to make regular
backing up of your databases in a Kubernetes environment trivially simple, with integrated support
for shipping those backups off to S3 (or an S3 compatible service like [Minio][]).

<!-- more -->

## Features

- Fully containerized with an environment-variable based API for easy use with Kubernetes.
- Full support for streaming backups to S3 compatible storage systems.
- Stores backups using the current date in a format which allows for easy scheduled rotation.
- Simple and easy to audit or extend.

## Supported Databases
We have created versions of Minback with support for the following databases. You will find their
containers in the Docker Hub under the `minback` namespace.

### MongoDB
This container provides a trivially simple means to run `mongodump` and fire the results off
to a [Minio][] instance or S3. It is intended to be run in conjunction with a [Kubernetes CronJob][]
to maintain a frequent backup of your critical data with minimal fuss.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file backup.env minback/mongo my_db -h mongoserver1
```

```bash
# backup.env
MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io/
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecret
MINIO_BUCKET=backups
```

#### Configuration
This container is configured using environment variables, enabling it to easily be started
manually or automatically and integrate well with Kubernetes' configuration framework.

##### `MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io/`
The Minio server you wish to send backups to.

##### `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio`
The Access Key used to connect to your Minio server.

##### `MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecret`
The Secret Key used to connect to your Minio server.

##### `MINIO_BUCKET=backups`
The Minio bucket you wish to store your backup in.

##### `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
(Optional) The OpenSSL symmetric key to protect the archive with.  Should be sufficiently long to prevent dictionary based attacks.

##### `DATE_FORMAT=+%Y-%m-%d`
The date format you would like to use when naming your backup files. Files are named `$DB-$DATE.archive`.

### PostgreSQL
This container provides a trivially simple means to run `pg_dump` and fire the results off
to a [Minio][] instance or S3. It is intended to be run in conjunction with a [Kubernetes CronJob][]
to maintain a frequent backup of your critical data with minimal fuss.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file backup.env minback/postgres my_db -h pgserver1
```

```bash
# backup.env
MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io/
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecret
MINIO_BUCKET=backups

## Backup Rotation
In most production settings, you will likely not want to retain all of your backups indefinitely. The process
of removing older backups is referred to as "backup rotation" and Minback provides a helpful container to
assist with this.

### Usage
```
USAGE:
   minback-cleanup cleanup [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --server value           [$MINIO_SERVER]
   --access-key value       [$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY]
   --secret-key value       [$MINIO_SECRET_KEY]
   --bucket value          (default: "backups") [$MINIO_BUCKET]
   --db value              The name of the database backup files (my-db-2017-12-19.backup would use 'my-db')
   --keep value, -k value  @7d/1d will keep a backup every 1d for all backups 7d old or older
```

### Keep Specifications
A keep specification is composed of three different properties:
1. **Window** (`@`) tells us when this window starts to apply from. It defaults to "right now" and can be
   extended out with a time duration, for example `52w` tells us that the window starts at 1 year and
   continues into the past from there.

   Windows "stack", so `@52w` and `@4w` will combine to have one specification applying from `4w` to `52w`
   and the next from `52w` onwards.

2. **Spacing** (`/`) tells us which backups within a window to keep. A spacing of `15m` will keep any
   backups which fall on the `15m` boundary (according to their timestamp) - so `:00`, `:15`, `:30` and `:45`.

3. **Smudge Factor** (`~`) tells us that we should round the backup's time to the nearest provided duration.
   This is great for situations where your backup's timestamp is a lot more accurate than your window and you
   wish to smudge things to ensure it falls on a boundary.

   For example, a smudge of `~15m` will convert `11:13:18` to `11:15:00` and have it match the `/15m` spacing
   we selected previously. You can also use larger smudges like `~1d` or even `~52w` (for a year), but keep in
   mind that we don't de-duplicate things if multiple backups match because of the same smudge factor.

You define a keep specification by concatenating each property's control character with its duration and listing
them in any order you wish.

::: tip
#### `@2w/1d~6h`
In this example, let's assume we create a new backup every 6 hours but only want to store one backup per day
for everything older than 2 weeks (i.e. your 6 hour frequency is for short-term recovery).

1. **Window** is 2 weeks (`2w`), meaning this specification will only apply to backups older than 2 weeks,
   and until an older window is found.
2. **Spacing** is 1 day (`1d`), meaning we will keep one backup per day within this window. Backups will be selected
   based on their timestamp and only those which match (after smudging) the day boundary will be kept.
3. **Smudge Factor** is 6 hours (`6h`) which ensures that backups which occur up to 3 hours either side of the
   day boundary (midnight) will be kept.
:::


### Example
In this example, let's assume we have a very aggressive backup schedule that
creates a new backup every minute. We would like to keep:

 - Every backup for the last `1h`
 - A backup every `15m` after `1h`
 - A backup every `1h` after `6h`
 - A backup every week (`7d`) after 1 week
 - A backup every 4 weeks (`4w`) after a month (`4w`)
 - A backup every year after 3 years (`156w`)

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file backup.env minback/cleanup cleanup \
    --db my_db \
    --keep "@1h/15m~5m" \
    --keep "@6h/1h~15m" \
    --keep "@7d/1w~1d" \
    --keep "@4w/4w~1w" \
    --keep "@52w/156w~1w"
```

```bash
# backup.env
MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=miniosecret
MINIO_BUCKET=backups
```

### Configuration
You can configure command line options using environment variables if you wish.

#### `MINIO_SERVER=https://play.minio.io`
The Minio server you wish to send backups to.

#### `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio`
The Access Key used to connect to your Minio server.
