# Ductile Burnout
Burnout is one of those terms that most of us have heard
used in our professional lives, many of us have been
subject to, and yet few of us really have a means of
grasping the severity of the problem or when it goes
too far.

Hopefully this post will give you some ideas no how to
reason about burnout in both your professional and
personal environments.

## Material Science
Okay, so I bet you didn't think that the first thing I'd
be talking about in a post about burnout would be something
from first year engineering; and yet here we go. Let's talk
a little bit about ductility and Young's modulus.

Young's modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material,
and in particular the relationship between the amount that the
material is stretched and the amount of force required to do so.
In the material science world they talk about this in terms of
stress and strain (where stress is the ratio of force to surface
area/thickness and strain is the ratio of change in length).

Where things get interesting is that the Young's modulus of a
material is not necessarily constant. For ductile materials in
particular, there are some really interesting dynamics as you
start to increase stress beyond certain key limits.

## What is Burnout?
Burnout on the other hand has nothing to do with material science
(unless you're a material scientist or civil engineer who is heavily
overworked) and instead is a term used to describe a number of symptoms
commonly associated with prolonged stress.

A lot of people assume that burnout is simply a matter of "working too hard"
and this leads to many outright rejecting the idea that they might be
burnt out (especially those who are highly driven and ambitious). The reality
is that Burnout is far more complex and nuanced than that.

In practice, burnout is characterized on three different dimensions
and someone suffering from burnout may find themselves subject to any
one, or multiple, of these symptoms:

 - A feeling of physical, mental, and/or emotional exhaustion.
 - A feeling of detachment/withdrawal, increased cynicism, and/or reduced empathy.
 - A feeling of being ineffective, under-performing, and/or low morale.

 Crucially, it is important to recognize that all of the above are
 how the person experiencing burnout feels, and they may not have any bearing
 on their objective performance. Often, people who are burnt out will still
 continue to perform at a high level, however their feelings may not mirror
 this.

 ## Ductile Burnout
 Now this is where we merge these two concepts. In most of the conversations
 I've had about burnout, there is a tendency to assume that it is primarily
 a matter of doing too much work, and that taking a holiday will allow the
 person enough time to recover.

 My personal experience is that this is rarely, if ever, the case. In my
 quest to quantify my experience, I came across the idea of elastic and
 plastic deformation as a metaphor for how burnout impacts people and why
 what may work to alleviate it for some may not work for others.

### Elastic Deformation
Switching back to our material science metaphor, elastic deformation is defined
over the range where applying increased stress results in a linear increase in
strain (burnout). Within this range, any reduction in stress will result in a
commensurate reduction in strain (recovery).

This is the ideal case for burnout. If you're starting to notice any symptoms
of burnout, taking a break and reducing your stress levels should allow you to
recover and return to your normal state. This is one of the reasons why it's so
valuable to encourage your on-call engineers to take time off after a major incident
(without it counting against their vacation allowance).

::: tip
After periods of increased stress on your team, whether that be a major incident, or
a large release, it's important to encourage your team to take a break and recover.
That can be anything from taking them out for a meal together, or giving them a day
off. Doing so will help ensure that they are able to return to their normal, healthy,
state and will ensure that they are better equipped to handle any future stressors.
:::

If managed well, keeping your people in this elastic range will allow you to quickly
recover from any major sources of stress and ensure that your team is consistently
performing at a high level. Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to identify where
the limits of this range are and they vary for each individual.

### Yield Stress
The yield stress of a material is the amount of stress required to cause a
permanent deformation. It is characterized by a sharp drop-off in the amount
of stress required to increase strain (burnout) and in the human context is
often the point at which you'll first notice a person "snap".

In practice, this is usually something small - an ask for help from someone
who never complains about their workload, a request for a change in process
from someone who has never raised an issue before, or simply an emotional
outburst from someone who has always been a model of calm.

This is often the point at which well intentioned and attentive leaders will start
to pay attention, believing that this is the start of burnout - and they'll often
encourage the person to take a break. Unfortunately, if you've truly exceeded the
yield stress of the individual, you're already too late for a short break to be
an effective recovery mechanism.

::: warning
If you notice that someone is starting to show signs of burnout, recognize that
there is a good chance that you are either about to, or have already passed, the
point where taking a break or slightly reducing their workload is unlikely to help
them recover.
:::

The reason for this is that at this point you've almost certainly pushed the
individual to the point where there is now a degree of latent association
between the work they do and the stress that has built up, or their responsibilities
have simply built up to the point where "normal workload" is beyond their safe capacity.

In practice, what we'll often to is offer to help out with something - reducing
the amount of stress applied to the individual by a small degree, but you'll
notice that beyond the yield point, the amount of stress required to cause an increase
in strain (burnout) is reduced; so even this might not be enough to reduce the burnout
experienced by the individual.

In my experience, the way to deal with burnout at this level is to make significant,
material, changes to the workload of the individual (or the team). This can be anything
from re-assigning a portion of their projects, to moving them to a different team, or
working with them to identify specific changes that will give them confidence that
the same scenario that led to this level of burnout will not happen again.

::: tip
For most organizations, the impact that a motivated and engaged individual can have is
proportional to their organizational context and the quality of their organizational
network. People who have been working at your organization for a long time will almost
universally be more valuable than an external replacement, even if you have to move them
to a different team or re-assign some of their responsibilities.

Notably, doing either of these things doesn't require you to stop giving them challenging
work (in fact, supporting them through this is likely to give them the confidence to tackle
more challenging work in the future, knowing that they will be supported).
:::

### Plastic Deformation
If you've pushed a material beyond its yield stress, you've entered the plastic
deformation region. In this region, the material will deform permanently and will
not return to its original shape when the stress is removed. Additionally, for ductile
materials, the amount of stress required to increase strain (burnout) will no longer
be linear and may in fact decrease while increasing strain (burnout).

When it comes to people, this is the point at which you'll almost certainly start
to notice a change in their behavior. They may start to withdraw from the team,
become more cynical, argumentative, and/or express displeasure at aspects of their
environment that they previously accepted. You're also likely to notice them exhibiting
signs of physical, emotional, or mental exhaustion, as well as being more sensitive
to their performance. Paradoxically, this latter point may often lead to these
individuals putting in additional effort to try and compensate for their perceived
decline in performance.

::: danger
If you have someone who is heavily burnt out, continuing to expose them to stress
will have a permanent impact on their ability to recover and is far more likely to
result in the person leaving your organization altogether.

If it becomes obvious that you've pushed someone to this point, you should take
immediate steps to significantly reduce their workload and ensure that they have
the support they need to recover. This recovery will often require active work
from your part to help address the feelings of detachment/withdrawal, cynicism,
exhaustion, and inefficacy that the person is likely to be feeling.
:::

The primary challenge at this point is that simply reducing stress will not solve
the problem. Asking the person to take some time off, even an extended vacation,
will often have no effect on their recovery (with them often returning to the same
state of burnout within days of returning to work). At this point, it is easy to
fall into the trap of believing that the issue is external (i.e. it's something
the person is dealing with in their own life and that as a manager there isn't much
you can/should do about it).

The reality is quite the opposite. This is the time where, as a manager,
you are singularly positioned to support the recovery (and retention) of
this person. The steps you'll need to take will vary on a case by case basis,
but fundamentally you need to reset the person's context and experience of
their environment (think of this as re-forging the spring that has been over-stretched).

Keep in mind that the person in question is likely to associate any of their
prior stressors (whether that be late working hours, work on a specific project,
working with a specific person or team, etc.) with the burnout they are experiencing
and continued exposure is likely to make recovery impossible. As such, you'll likely
need to work with the person to identify the source of these stressors and then
support them in making changes to their role, responsibilities, or environment to
remove or reduce them.

::: tip
Permanent deformation is essentially the point at which a person starts to remember/recall
prior stressors whenever they are exposed to a lesser stressor. For example, a team who
knows that a particular partner team has previously been abusive will consistently
experience a higher level of stress when working with that partner team, even if the
partner team is being more reasonable than usual.
:::

### Ultimate Strength
As you proceed to increase the stress applied to a material, you'll notice (even in
the plastic deformation region) that the amount of stress required to increase strain
does continue to increase. At some point, you'll reach the maximum amount of stress
that the material can withstand before it begins to break. To use the analogy of a spring,
this is the point at which you've stretched the spring to the point that it is a wire
and if you begin to apply any additional force it will start to thin out (necking) and eventually
snap.

In the case of people, many of our most driven and ambitious individuals will tend to mistake
their ultimate strength for their yield stress, assuming that they can continue to push themselves
just a little bit further without breaking. Unfortunately, beyond this point burnout continues to
increase even as we lower the amount of stress applied. For these individuals, this leads to a
rapid decline which will often result in them leaving the organization (and often with strong
negative feelings towards the organization in the process).

:::danger
Many of us mistake our ultimate strength for our yield stress. If you're pushing yourself
beyond the signs of burnout and finding that taking a break doesn't leave you feeling recovered,
you should seriously consider whether you are making the same mistake and take appropriate steps
to reduce your stress levels before you impact your health.

As a manager, this is the point where you should probably be working to support the person in
finding a new role or organization in an effort to completely reset their context as quickly
as possible.

## Conclusion
While this post is written with professional burnout in mind, the same metaphor applies to many
other areas of life where one is exposed to stress. For example, if you're a student, you may
notice that you're experiencing similar symptoms throughout your semester. If you're a parent,
you may notice that you're experiencing similar patterns as your children go through different
stages of development and their own challenges. And finally, if you're in a relationship, you may
find that the same phases of burnout apply to your feelings in the relationship as well.

Regardless of the context, it's important to recognize that stress is a natural part of life and
that managing strain (burnout) to ensure that you are able to recover after a period of stress
is a critical part of maintaining your health and well-being. Pushing yourself beyond this elastic
limit is far more likely to permanently impact your quality of life and if you have the ability to
prevent yourself from doing so, or help others to do the same, you should really do so.
