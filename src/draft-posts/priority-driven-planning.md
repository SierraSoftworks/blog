    We've been using a process we've come to call "Priority Driven Planning" to
    run a portion of our development team for the last 9 months and it's been an
    amazing success, I'd like to tell you a little bit about it and how it works.

# Priority Driven Planning
About 6 months ago I wrote about a new [planning process](/2021/06/14/tactical-planning/)
that our team had adopted and some of the mechanics of how it worked,
as well as motivations behind its implementation. Today I'd like to
cover some of what we've seen over the intervening 6 months, the changes
that have occurred and the lessons we've learned from it.

<!-- more -->

## The Start
When we first introduced this process, I was just starting to get to
grips to being a named technical leader for a group of engineers. I
had been filling this role for several months and had been chasing
engineers for status updates on their work items, keeping our backlog
and work board up to date, and generally trying to wrangle a view of
what was happening and align that with reality.

I was also absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of work that I needed
to do to try and make sure that important projects were executed on,
that we delivered on time, and that we all met the other requirements
placed on us by the organization. To say that it wasn't working would
be a bit of an understatement.

It also didn't feel like it was working for anyone who was involved,
with most of the engineers feeling like they weren't meeting their
goals or delivering anything of measurable value, or being recognized
for their work. We tried to improve this with morale-boosting call-outs
of completed work, and a constant drive to "reduce the size of work items
so that we complete them more frequently", but this never seemed to
improve things.

## Implementation
So, we tossed all of the day-to-day processes out, ditched the sprint
board, and kicked open a basic document with the following structure:

> ## Person 1
> **Priorities**: x, y, z
> **Risks**: a, b, c
>
> ...

We were going to do things a bit differently, we were going to spend
our "sprint planning" meetings having engineers talk about their main
high level project priorities. These were the projects they'd be working
on over the next month or two, and I'd provide feedback on which of those
work streams should be their highest priority for a given week. We'd talk
about any foreseeable risks that might require them to change those
priorities mid-week, and how we'd respond if they did.

At the end of the week, we'd talk again about whether they actually spent
their time working on their priorities and, if not, what they did instead
and why. We'd talk about whether this was a good decision or a bad one
and how we could improve it next time it came up.

### Rollout
Initially, these meetings involved a lot of back-and-forth between the
engineers and me as we aligned on the team's priorities and how we'd
handle different situations. It required a clear vision of our road map
and how we were going to execute on it, which placed a heavy up-front
burden on me, but acted as a forcing function for us to get that vision
documented well and frequently iterated on.

Over time, though, the conversations turned into more of a formality. 
Engineers would show up with a solid list of priorities that didn't need
adjusting, their risks would be relevant and well-scoped, they'd rarely
work on things outside their top priorities and when they did, it was
unquestionably the right decision.

About 6 months into this process, we switched lead on this team - having
another engineer step in and lead the process. I think changing the 
leadership of a group is always an interesting test of how robust the
systems you've built really are, and in this case the transition couldn't
have gone better. 6 months after that hand-off, and the team is still
using the same process we originally created, but the benefits have
continued to compound.

## Impact
So, with the benefit of being able to look at a year's worth of
experience with this process, let's talk about some of the things
we've seen it do. This is the part that gets me excited, because
there have been some layers of impact that I could never have foreseen
when we first started this journey.

### Overhead
Okay, so the process is simple. Really simple. Simple enough that it
makes people raise their eyebrows and say "That doesn't sound like it's
going to work". It's the kind of simple that makes it possible for a
senior engineer to lead a team of 4 engineers, take on 4 additional 
engineers from around the organization (training them up, sharing 
knowledge, working on cross-cutting projects, etc.), and then have
time left over to work on technical projects themselves.

::: tip IMPACT
One of the biggest things that this simplicity has unlocked is an
ability to scale the team flexibly and with very little additional
burden on the team's leadership. This has caused it to be a hub for
cross-cutting partnerships, where engineers from other teams across
the organization will spend 6 months embedded with this team, learning
from them and contributing to critical projects.
:::

The overhead goes both ways as well, leaving engineers with far more
time to focus on their actual work and fewer steps to worry about when
executing on their work.

### Competence
We often equate an engineer's ability to operate without supervision
with their seniority. More junior engineers are expected to require
more oversight and guidance, while more senior engineers are expected
to require less of it. In practice though, this is a terrible way to
think about it - because it doesn't map to the value that an engineer
brings to an organization and places a disproportionately high cost
on supporting your more junior engineers (who have a correspondingly
lower value to the organization in the immediate term).

Instead, it's worth evaluating an engineer's seniority by looking at
the scope of impact that they are able to drive within the organization.
This is the same way that promotions are evaluated, and for good reason,
it's the thing that matters most to the organization's bottom line. 
Micro-managing your junior engineers is an anti-pattern and one that
sets them up for failure as they become more senior and are expected to
deliver broader impact with less top-down direction.

This process has the interesting side-effect of requiring every engineer,
regardless of seniority, to take ownership of their full project 
lifecycle, including the prioritization, planning, execution, and 
reporting of their work. The scope contained within that work will grow
as their capabilities increase, but the nature of the work remains the
same whether you are an intern or a senior engineer on the team.
As a consequence, those engineers are constantly developing the skills
they'll need to be successful later in their careers.

::: tip IMPACT
The most profound impact I've seen as a result of this is that engineers
who joined us from environments where they felt under-valued, or who
lacked the confidence of their peers, have progressively become more and
more competent, driven, and engaged in the work they do and the team
they're a part of. I see them stepping up to help on-board new engineers,
or volunteering to help out on challenging new problems that appear.
I've seen this environment bring out the absolute best in every engineer
who has joined us.

### Vision
By its very nature, this process forces engineers to take a step back
from the work they are doing day-to-day and instead look at the overarching
vision. It's not possible to come prepared with good priorities if you
don't understand what the vision is, nor is it possible for a leader to
have a discussion about those priorities if they're not clear on how we're
going to accomplish that vision.

::: warning
For this to succeed, your leadership need to be able to clearly articulate
and motivate for a vision. That vision also needs to be effectively communicated
(i.e. understood). Without this, it is impossible for your engineers to gain
clarity by "looking up", and if done poorly, engineers who do the right thing
will be rewarded with negative outcomes for the company.
:::

The end result is that at every layer of the team's leadership, it forces
people to look to the level above for a vision and use that to drive a
clear set of priorities and work streams. In many dysfunctional teams that
I've been a part of, the more senior engineers attempt to think through how
the more junior engineers should do their job, while in this model there's
an incentive for the senior engineers to think about how their managers would
like them to do their job (and this "looking up" cascades down the chain).

By placing such a heavy emphasis on the team's vision and our ability to
communicate it effectively, we've created an environment where regular strategic
planning and iteration has immediately visible impact. Somewhat less immediately
visible is the team's ability to present a cohesive story to senior leadership
on their plans and how they have been able to execute on them.

::: tip IMPACT
This has led to a substantial increase in the amount of trust that senior
leadership and partners place in the team, as they are able to present a
cohesive plan for the future and demonstrate how that plan has been executed
against in the past.

## Lessons Learned
Of course, all this doesn't come without a bunch of caveats and over the
past year, we've had plenty of time to learn from the mistakes we've made,
iterate on our process, and consider what other factors have enabled this
to be a success in our context.

### Put your people first
Okay, this is going to sound obvious to some, but if you're not putting
the health of the people on your team first, then nothing you do here is
going to succeed in the long term.

### Have a team charter


### Have a road map
Yes, you need to have a vision for where you're going, but in order to make
good decisions on a weekly basis you'll also need a structured road map that
your team can rally around. It doesn't need to be overly complex, but it should
capture the high level milestones that you're going to deliver on your path to
that vision, and it should identify key projects that form each of the next
few milestones.

As a team leader, you'll need to be able to communicate priorities with clear
reference to this road map and have a clear understanding of how your team's
work aligns (or doesn't align) with the current milestone.
