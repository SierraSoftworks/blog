# Type Converters in Rust
Advent of Code 2023 has just kicked off, and I'm going to try something a bit
different this year, I'm going to try and share useful concepts and patterns
that play a role in solving each day's puzzle.

Today, we're looking at how type converters work in Rust, and how you can use
them to create intuitive interfaces for your types.

## What are Type Converters?
Type converters are present in most languages, they're a means of converting one
type into another. This is extremely common when converting between primitive types
like integers and floating point numbers, where the traditional C-style syntax would
be something like: `(int)floatValue`.

Different languages have different syntaxes for this, but the concept is the same:
take a value of one type, and convert it to a value of another type. From a function
signature perspective, we're looking for `fn convert(from: T) -> U`, where `T` and `U`
are different types.

## Types of Type Converters
This kind of conversion is so common in practical code that instead of having each
type implement its own conversion interface, most languages provide a standard
means of doing so. This sounds great, until you realize that in the world of type
conversions, one size really doesn't fit all.

Let's take C# for example:

```csharp
object input = 42.5;

// Here we expect to do a fast "cast" from the input to an integer.
// If it fails, we expect to get a TypeCastException.
var intValue = (int)input;

// Here we expect to get null if the conversion fails, but it should
// still be a fast operation.
var maybeIntValue = input as int;

// Here we expect to run some kind of parsing logic across the input
// (i.e. it's likely to be more costly and could fail with an exception).
Convert.ToInt32(input);
```

Each of these patterns conveys meaning to the reader, and each of them has its own
set of tradeoffs which the author of the code needs to consider before using them.
As such, having different syntaxes for each of them is actually quite useful. In
general, we can break down type conversions into three categories:

 - **Fast, Safe, Casts**: These are used when the conversion is expected to be
   fast, and the conversion is expected to succeed. If the conversion fails, it
   should throw an exception or panic (but this should be rare/never happen).
 - **Fast, Maybe Casts**: These are used when the conversion is expected to be
   fast, and the conversion is expected to fail. If the conversion fails, it
   should return an indication of the failure (i.e. `null` or `None`).
 - **Slow, Parsing**: These are used when the conversion is expected to be
    slow, and the conversion is expected to fail. If the conversion fails, it
    should surface detailed information about why it failed (i.e. an exception
    with a detailed message, or a `Err` in Rust).

In the Rust world, these look like the following:

```rust

// Fast, Safe, Casts
let input = 42.5 as i32;
// or using the `From`/`Into` traits
let value = input.into();

// Fast, Maybe Casts
let value = input.try_into()?;

// Slow, Parsing
let value = input.parse::<i32>()?;
```

## Type Converter APIs
A challenge of language design when it comes to type coercion is the question of
how best to satisfy the "Open-Closed Principle" (O in SOLID). In other words, how
do you allow developers to introduce type converters without needing to modify types
that they don't own?

Let's take the example of me wanting to implement a `DateTimeLocation` type which
wraps a `DateTime` and a `Location` (i.e. a latitude and longitude). I'd like to
be able to easily convert bi-directionally between a `DateTimeLocation` and a
`DateTime` or `Location`, but I don't want to have to modify the `DateTime` or
`Location` types to do so.

If your language doesn't have support for bi-directional type converters, you're
going to need to implement two different APIs: a forward converter and a reverse
converter. This works, but it really isn't the nicest API to use since it requires
that people using your API switch to calling methods on your type rather than
relying on the language's built-in type conversion syntax.

```python
class DateTimeLocation:
    def __init__(self, date_time: datetime, location: Location = None):
        self.date_time = date_time
        self.location = location

    def to_date_time(self) -> datetime:
        return self.date_time

    def to_location(self) -> Location:
        return self.location

my_date_time = DateTimeLocation(datetime.now(), Location(36.12, -86.67))

# I can't do this (which would be the normal Pythonic way to convert between types)
# because I can't modify the `datetime` type.
date = datetime(my_date_time)

# Instead, I need to do this:
date = my_date_time.to_date_time()
```

This is where Rust comes in, providing a default implementation of the `U: Into<T>` trait
for any type which implements `T: From<U>`. This means that if I implement `Into<Date> for DateTimeLocation`, anyone can convert a `DateTimeLocation` into a `Date` by calling `date_time_location.into()` or by using `Date::from(date_time_location)`.

This intrinsic bi-directionality means that I can easily extend the type conversion 
semantics of types I don't control, so long as I control the type on one side of the
conversion. C# has a similar ability (though it does require explicitly defining the
conversion methods for `U -> T` and `T -> U` on your type `T`).

## Implementing Type Converters in Rust
Let's take the example of implementing a new type converter in Rust, in this case to parse
a simple file format. Let's imagine that we have a file which looks like the following:

```
# <id>: <value>, <value>, <value>, ...
1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

We'd like to parse this into a series of `Record`s, where each record has an `id` 
corresponding to the number at the start of the line, and a series of `values` corresponding
to the numbers after the colon.

```rust
struct Record {
    id: u32,

    values: Vec<u32>,
}
```

### Using the From Trait
The simplest way to implement this would be to use the `From` trait, which allows us to
implement a conversion from one type to another. In this case, we'd like to implement
`From<String> for Record`, which would allow us to convert a `String` into a `Record`.

::: tip
If we use `From<String>` then we need to pass around ownership over the `String` itself,
which means that we'll need to clone it if we want to keep a copy of it. We can instead
implement `From<T>` for all types which implement `AsRef<str>` (i.e. `&str`, `String`, etc)
and then use `&str` as our input type. This means that we can pass around references to
the original string, and we don't need to clone it.
:::

```rust
impl<T> From<T> for Record
where
    T: AsRef<str>,
{
    fn from(input: T) -> Self {
        let input = input.as_ref();

        let (id, values) = input.split_once(':').unwrap();

        let id = id.trim().parse::<u32>().unwrap();
        let values = values
            .split(',')
            .map(|v| v.trim().parse::<u32>().unwrap())
            .collect();

        Self { id, values }
    }
}
```

This allow us to construct our list of records by doing the following:

```rust
let records = input
    .lines()
    // We filter out any empty lines or comments
    .filter(|l| !l.is_empty() && !l.starts_with('#'))
    // And then convert each line into a Record
    .map(Record::from)
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

This is great, but you'll notice that we're using a lot of `.unwrap()` calls in
our `From` implementation. In general, `.unwrap()` is a pretty risky thing to do
as it'll result in a `panic!()` when something goes wrong. Instead, we'd prefer
to have the ability to handle those errors gracefully...

### Using the TryFrom Trait
This is where the `TryFrom` trait comes in. This is similar to the `From` trait,
but instead of always returning a value, it returns a `Result` which can either
be the successfully converted value, or an error.

This allows us to propagate errors up to the caller, and handle them gracefully
without crashing the process.

```rust
impl<T> TryFrom<T> for Record
where
    T: AsRef<str>,
{
    type Error = Box<dyn std::error::Error>;

    fn try_from(input: T) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let input = input.as_ref();

        let (id, values_str) = input.split_once(':')
            .ok_or(format!("Invalid format, expected '<id>: <value>, ...'."))?;

        let id = id.trim().parse::<u32>()
            .map_err(|err| format!("Invalid ID: {err}"))?;

        let values = Vec::new();
        for value in values_str.split(',') {
            let value = value.trim().parse::<u32>()
                .map_err(|err| format!("Invalid value: {err}"))?;

            values.push(value);
        }

        Ok(Self { id, values })
    }
}
```

Now, when we go to use this, we can handle these errors a bit more gracefully:

```rust
let records = input
    .lines()
    // We filter out any empty lines or comments
    .filter(|l| !l.is_empty() && !l.starts_with('#'))
    // And then convert each line into a Record
    .map(|line| Record::try_from(line).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Failed to parse line: {err}");
        // Oh, did I say gracefully? I meant just kill the process...
        std::process::exit(1);
    }))
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

Now this is all well and good, but you might have noticed that we're using `.try_from()`
while inside our implementation we're using `.parse()` to try to convert string values
into numbers. What's up with that?

### Using the FromStr Trait
It turns out that parsing strings into other types is a common enough pattern that Rust
gives it its own special treatment. Any type which implements the `FromStr` trait can
be parsed from a string using the `.parse()` method. It works almost identically to the
`TryFrom` trait, except that it's implemented for `&str` rather than `T`.

In practice, this simplifies the type signature for our implementation a little bit, and
also means that someone reading our code can more easily see that we're doing some string
parsing.

```rust
impl FromStr for Record {
    type Err = Box<dyn std::error::Error>;

    fn from_str(input: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        let (id, values_str) = input.split_once(':')
            .ok_or(format!("Invalid format, expected '<id>: <value>, ...'."))?;

        let id = id.trim().parse::<u32>()
            .map_err(|err| format!("Invalid ID: {err}"))?;

        let values = Vec::new();
        for value in values_str.split(',') {
            let value = value.trim().parse::<u32>()
                .map_err(|err| format!("Invalid value: {err}"))?;

            values.push(value);
        }

        Ok(Self { id, values })
    }
}
```

All this allows us to write our code like this:

```rust
let records = input
    .lines()
    // We filter out any empty lines or comments
    .filter(|l| !l.is_empty() && !l.starts_with('#'))
    // And then convert each line into a Record
    .map(|line| line.parse().unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Failed to parse line: {err}");
        // Oh, did I say gracefully? I meant just kill the process...
        std::process::exit(1);
    }))
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

## Pairing Type Converters with Iterators
As a last bit of fun, let's look at how you can pair what we covered yesterday
in [Iterators in Rust](./2023-12-01-rust-iterators.md) with type converters to
be able to easily consume a stream of data and convert it into our desired types.

```rust
struct RecordIterator<'a> {
    value: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> Iterator for RecordIterator<'a> {
    // We have our iterator return a Result, so that we can propagate errors
    type Item = Result<Record, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        if let Some((record, rest)) = self.value.split_once('\n') {
            self.value = rest;

            Some(record.parse())
        }

        None
    }
}
```

And now we can use this iterator to parse our records:

```rust
for record in RecordIterator { ... } {
    match record {
        Ok(record) => { ... },
        Err(err) => { ... },
    }
}

// Or if we want to collect them into a Vec and discard anything that failed to parse:
let records = RecordIterator { ... }
    .filter_map(Result::ok)
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

## Conclusion
Type converters are a great way to encapsulate the logic for converting between different
types, and there are several different ways to implement them in Rust. The `From` trait
is great for fast, safe, casts, the `TryFrom` trait is great for fast, maybe casts, and
the `FromStr` trait is great for slow parsing from strings.

Pairing these with iterators allows us to easily consume streams of data and convert them
into our desired types, and using `FromStr` lets us handle errors gracefully (which saves
everyone a ton of time when things go wrong).
